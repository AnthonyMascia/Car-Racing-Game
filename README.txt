This document containes all the information you should need to begin developing. For this project we are using the AppGameKit to develop a racing game. 

# Tools #
#########

1. AppGameKit (http://files.thegamecreators.com/agk/AppGameKitTrial.zip)
2. Microsoft Visual Studio (You could probably use other editors but MS08 works best and i dont think AGK works on MAC)
3. BitBucket (Issue Tracking, Version Control, and peer reviewing) 

# Set up the development environment #
######################################

1. Download the AGK installer (http://files.thegamecreators.com/agk/AppGameKitTrial.zip)

2. Run the installer and change the install path to a distinct directory for our project 
   (If you still have it installed from Game Dev class then you can skip this part)

3. Once you have AGK installed navigate the AGK files to the templates directory
   (\IDE\templates)

4. Clone the project files into this directory and you can begin working.
